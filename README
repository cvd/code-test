The problem:
You want to be able to take any valid html that is decorated with a certain set of classes
and impose a form on top of it to allow users to select what data should go into each of those elements.
The spec for the input html is as follows: Any element (html tag) that is to have some data put into it is
decorated with the class 'option' and each element with the class 'option' should have a unique ID that should
be used as form input name for the form element that is placed within it. The options for the user to select
between are the following key-value pairs:
  OPTIONS = [
    [nil , "Choose Field: "],
    [:teamkey, "Team Name"],
    [:agekey,  "Team Age"],
    [:coach_name, "Coach Name"],
    [:team_rating,"Team Rating"]
  ]

The key should be the option 'value' and the value should be the option text.

Use the input.html file as a sample input file.
